# Domain Pack: ESP32 Firmware

Domain-specific guidance for ESP32 projects (ESP-IDF or Arduino-ESP32). Load this
pack **only** when the project matches the detection signals below; otherwise the
platform-independent core (`references/test-architecture.md`) is enough.

## Detection signals

Treat the project as ESP32 firmware if any of these are present:

- Files: `sdkconfig`, `sdkconfig.defaults`, `platformio.ini`, `partitions*.csv`,
  `idf_component.yml`, `CMakeLists.txt` with `idf_component_register`.
- Code/symbols: `esp_`, `ESP_LOG`, `nvs_`, `esp_wifi`, `esp_mqtt`, `esp_ota`,
  `NimBLE`/`esp_ble`, `tinyusb`/`tusb_`, `app_main`, FreeRTOS tasks.
- Description mentions: ESP32 / ESP32-C3/S3/etc., ESP-IDF, Arduino-ESP32, a named
  dev board, or the chip's peripherals.

## Layer profile (for FSD §2.4)

Embedded layer contents — apply the core ownership rule (library/managed client to
an external service = foundation; hand-written decoder/driver/handler = interface):

- **L0 — Foundation / transport**: WiFi, VPN (e.g. WireGuard), the MQTT *client*,
  NVS/flash, the RTOS (boot + scheduling), `esp_http_client`/server stacks. Tested
  transitively.
- **L1 — Interfaces**: hand-written protocol decoders (DLMS/OBIS, custom UART
  framing), bus drivers (Modbus, I²C/SPI device drivers), device HTTP handlers
  (captive portal, status portal, OTA receiver), provisioning client. Pure
  converter/policy core on the host tier; wire/flow on target/bench.
- **L2 — Application logic**: control loops, state machines, scheduling/decision
  logic. Pure functions on the host tier.

These three are the common default. A project may **add layers** if it genuinely
has more one-way-dependent tiers (e.g. a device-orchestration layer above several
control loops) — see `../test-architecture.md` ("Scale the layer count to the
system"). Each layer becomes its own body Part, and the source layout mirrors it
(one module per component; see "Source layout mirrors the layers").

## Test tiers (for the §x.0 Test Architecture, in the V&V chapter)

| Tier | Runs on | Speed | Catches |
|---|---|---|---|
| **host** | Dev machine, plain `gcc`/host build | ms, every commit | Pure logic: parsing, encoding, math, lookups, bounds. No ESP-IDF, no hardware. |
| **target** | The ESP32, real ESP-IDF | seconds, pre-merge | UART/I²C/SPI timing, NVS, the HTTP server, flash writes, RTOS behaviour. |
| **bench** | Device + real peers (sensors, broker, server) | minutes, pre-release | End-to-end; recovery, reconnection, timing. |
| **other** | — | — | Non-firmware (server/CI/silicon) or review-only. |

Extract each interface's pure core as a free function (e.g. a size/range
predicate separate from its HTTP/flash handler) so it is host-testable.

## Standard test libraries

Conditionally include standard test cases based on detected features. Scan the FSD
and source for the patterns, then fold the matching spec's tests into the test-spec
files that mirror the affected chapters (the generated traceability matrix picks
them up automatically).

### Workflow

1. Scan the FSD requirements and source code for the detection patterns above.
2. For each detected feature, read the corresponding `references/domains/esp32/*.md`.
3. Copy relevant requirements, functional tests, and edge cases into the FSD.
4. Update project-specific placeholders (SSIDs, IPs, timeouts, etc.).
5. Place the included tests in the spec files mirroring their chapters; the
   generated traceability matrix will reflect them (do not hand-edit the matrix).

### Spec files

All under `references/domains/esp32/`:

| File | Coverage |
